		<h1>Python CGOS Client</h1>
			
		This client connects Go programs that implement the <a href="http://www.lysator.liu.se/~gunnar/gtp/">GTP</a> 
		protocol to the	<a href="cgos.boardspace.net/">Computer Go Server</a> (CGOS). If you downloaded this,
		you know what they are.
		
		<h2>Information</h2>

		<h2 id="features">Features</h2>
		
		Features in common with standard CGOS TCL client:
		<ul>
		<li>Textual configuration file
		<li>Waits for server restart when server crashes or is unreachable (checks every 30 seconds + small random amount)
		<li>Supports resume if the engine crashes. Just restart the client and it will catch up the game.
		<li>Kill file to terminate connections
		</ul>
			
		<p>
		Additional features:
		<ul>
		<li>Local SGF persistence (with move times and results)
		<li>Support for <a href="#observer">observers</a>. Any GTP engine or display, 
			like <a href="http://gogui.sourceforge.net/">GoGUI</a>, can be used to observe games locally. 
		<li><a href="#ext">GTP extensions</a> that can help with your engine's logging
		<li>Separate detailed <a href="#logging">logging files</a> for: CGOS, the engine and the observer (if any). Standard output
			stream logging at high level for user observation.
		<li>From time to time, shows some stats: uptime, games won, games lost. May be expanded with e-mail notification in the future.
		</ul>
		
		<p>
		Features not yet supported:
		<ul>
		<li>Engine switching is not yet supported
		</ul>
		
		<h1 id="usage">Usage</h1>
		
		Developed on Python 2.6, no extensions required. It may work on Python 2.5, but that is not tested. If you are using Windows, 
		get the package	from <a href="http://www.python.org/download/windows/">here</a>, it's a good standalone installer. 
		You will have to provide a configuration file. See <code>sample.cfg</code> for an example, or see <a href="#samplecfg">below</a>.
		Run the client using:
		
		<pre># Windows
C:\Python26\Python bin\cgosclient.py config.cfg

# Unix		
python bin/cgosclient.py config.cfg</pre>
		
		To kill the client, please place a "kill file" in the location you specified in the configuration
		file. You may of course kill the process, too, but the kill file will ensure that you will finish
		the current game and log off nicely. After the engine quits, the kill file will be deleted.
		
		<p><b>Note:</b> If a kill file is put in place, the client will quit ASAP if it is not currently in 
		a game. In practice, this means when the next status message is received by the server, usually within a minute.
		 		
		
		<h2 id="gtp">GTP Commands</h2>
		
		<i>Playing</i> engines need the following GTP commands:
		<ul>
		<li>Mandatory: <b>list_commands</b>, <b>boardsize</b>, <b>clear_board</b>, <b>komi</b>, <b>play</b>, <b>genmove</b>, <b>quit</b>
		<li>Optional: <b>time_left</b>, <b>time_settings</b>
		</ul>
		
		If the time commands are missing, no time control instructions will be passed to the engine. Further notes:
		<ul>
		<li><b>time_left</b> will always be sent immediately before <b>genmove</b>, as with the TCL client
		<li><b>quit</b>: if your engine or observer takes too long to respond, it will be sent a terminate signal to
		make sure it does not get up anymore
		</ul>
		
		<h2 id="ext">GTP Extensions</h2>
		
		The following GTP extensions are available. If your engine records its own logs, or writes its own
		SGF records with analysis information in them, you may find them useful.
		
		<p>
		<table>
			<tr>
				<th>Command</th><th>When Called</th><th>Meaning</th>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<th>cgos-opponent_name</th>
				<td>Between boardsize and first move</td>
				<td>Gives the name of the opponent engine (the CGOS login name)</td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<th>cgos-gameover</th>
				<td>After two passes, resignation or illegal move</td>
				<td>
				Final result as reported by the server. Will be in format required by SGF 
				<a href="http://www.red-bean.com/sgf/properties.html#RE">RE</a> property, meaning:
				<ul>
				   <li><code>B+{score}</code> or <code>W+{score}</code>, e.g. <code>B+0.5</code>, or
				   <li><code>B+Resign</code> or <code>W+Resign</code>, or
				   <li><code>B+Time</code> or <code>W+Time</code>, or
				   <li><code>B+Forfeit</code> or <code>W+Forfeit</code>
				</ul>
			</tr>				   
		</table>
				 
		<h2 id="logging">Logging</h2>
		
		The client will produce the following log files at debug level - standard output stream
		logging is at info level or higher only:
		
		<ul>
		<li><b>engine.log</b> - Log of GTP command stream to and from the engine
		<li><b>cgos.log</b> - Client/server command stream
		<li><b>observer.log</b> - Log of GTP stream to observer GTP engine, if any
		</ul>
		
		All of these log files are set up as rolling files that be renamed <code>engine.log.1</code>,
		and so on, when they get beyond 2MB. A maximum of 5 rolling log files is kept.
		
		
		<h2 id="observer">Displaying Games Using GoGUI</h2>
		
		The Python CGOS client can stream the GTP command stream to a secondary engine called
		an "observer" engine. It is up to you how you use this, for example:
		<ul>
		<li>You could run a secondary copy of your program and show move evaluations
		<li>You can run GoGUI and get a local view of what your program is doing when it is
		playing. This means that a) you do not have to connect using the server viewing client
		and b) you save the server a bit of work.
		</ul> 	
	
		<p>
		First, download GoGUI from <a href="http://gogui.sourceforge.net/">gogui.sourceforge.net</a>.
		Next, make sure you use <code>gogui-display</code> as an observer in your configuration file,
		like so in Windows:
		
		<pre>GTPObserver:
    CommandLine = C:\Program Files\Java\jdk1.6.0_13\bin\java.exe -jar C:\path\to\gogui-1.1.9\lib\gogui-display.jar</pre>
    
    	Please do <b>not</b> use <code>javaw.exe</code>, stick with <code>java.exe</code>, or the input stream to
    	gogui-display will be cut off. In Linux:
    	
		<pre>GTPObserver:
    CommandLine = /usr/bin/java -jar /path/to/gogui-1.1.9/lib/gogui-display.jar</pre>
		
		Either way, please note that if you close the GoGUI window, the client will think the observer
		engine crashed and terminate your connection. You will then have to restart to resume your game.
		If you wish to stop displaying, put a kill file in place (see above), then start the client
		again without an observer.
		
		<h2 id="samplecfg">Sample Configuration</h2>
		
		This sample configuration shows how <a href="http://www.gnu.org/software/gnugo/">GNU Go</a>
		can be connected to play on CGOS, 9x9 board size, and with GoGUI running locally to view all
		games.
